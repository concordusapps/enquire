Inquire allows you to generate advanced query strings.
Currently supports [armet][armet] syntax query strings.

## Installation

Inquire is available on the npm registry: [inquire][inquire]

You can install it with npm.

    npm install inquire

Run the tests.

    npm test

Check the coverage.

    npm run cover

## The Problem

Currently, query strings only conjoin predicates together with equality.
[Armet][armet] attempts to extend this in two ways:

* Allowing predicates to be conjoined, disjoined and negated.
* Allowing more than just equality, e.g. inequalities.

This ends up creating a problem.
We now have to generate these advanced query strings.
Generating these advanced query strings by hand gets unwieldy.

For example, let's say we are dealing with a REST api for shapes.
We can `GET` on `/api/shape` and return all of the shapes.

Now let's try to get more detailed in our result.
Let's say we want red shapes wider than 30 pixels or
we want all shapes with no more than 12 sides or
we want all of the squares that either aren't black or that were created by bob.
Our `GET` request becomes:

`/api/shape?(color=red&width>30);sides<=12;(shape=square&(color!=black;user=bob))`


## A Solution

We need a better way to generate query strings for [armet][armet]'s consumption.
Inquire allows you do the same query without trying to man-handle the string.

LiveScript:

```livescript
query = inquire(inquire \color, \red .and inquire.gt \width, 30)
  ..or inquire.lte \sides, 12
  ..or (inquire \shape, \square .and (inquire.neq \color, \black .or \user, \bob))
url = "/api/shape/#{query}"
# url => /api/shape?(color=red&(width>30));(sides<=12);(shape=square&(color!=black;user=bob))
```

Javascript:

```javascript
query = inquire(inquire('color', 'red').and(inquire.gt('width', 30)))
.or(inquire.lte('sides', 12))
.or(inquire('shape', 'square').and(inquire.neq('color', 'black').or('user', 'bob')));
url = "/api/shape/" + query;
// url => /api/shape?(color=red&(width>30));(sides<=12);(shape=square&(color!=black;user=bob))
```

Note: At this time, inquire does not optimize away parens.

## Usage

The inquire class can be used to create a new predicate defaulting to equality.
There are multiple ways to create an `inquire`.

Passing just the key, value pair.

LiveScript:

```livescript
inquire \key, \value #=> ?key=value
```

Javascript:

```javascript
inquire('key', 'value'); //=> ?key=value
```

Passing an another `inquire`, which will end up wrapping it in parens.

LiveScript:

```livescript
inquire inquire \key, \value #=> ?(key=value)
```

Javascript:

```javascript
inquire(inquire('key', 'value')); //=> ?(key=value)
```
You can pass in an object, or an array of `inquire`'s.
Both of these conjoin their values by default and wrap in parens.

LiveScript:

```livescript
inquire {key1: \value1, key2: \value2} #=> ?(key1=value1&key2=value2)
inquire [inquire(\key1, \value1), inquire(\key2, \value2)] #=> ?((key1=value1)&(key2=value2))
```

Javascript:

```javascript
inquire({key1: 'value1', key2: 'value2'}); //=> ?(key1=value1&key2=value2)
inquire([inquire('key1', 'value1'), inquire('key2', 'value2')]); //=> ?((key1=value1)&(key2=value2))
```

You can change the default relation by calling a different operator.

LiveScript:

```livescript
inquire.gte \key, \value #=> key>=value
```

Javascript:

```javascript
inquire.gte('key', 'value'); //=> key>=value
```

The `and` and `or` predicates work in much the same way,
but require an already created `inquire`.

LiveScript:

```livescript
inquire \key1, \value1 .and \key2, \value2 #=> ?key1=value1&key2=value2
inquire \key1, \value1 .or \key2, \value2 #=> ?key1=value1;key2=value2
```

Javascript:

```javascript
inquire('key1', 'value1').and('key2', 'value2'); //=> ?key1=value1&key2=value2
inquire('key1', 'value1').or('key2', 'value2'); //=> ?key1=value1;key2=value2
```

`Inquire` supports three boolean operators `and`, `or`, and `not`.
These operators also take objects, arrays, and `inquire`'s.
In addition, `and` and `or` take `key`, `value` strings and construct the proper query.
The semantics for `and` and `or` are similar to the constructor taking these types,
and conjoining or disjoining it to the previous `inquire` with the proper operator.
For `not`, the argument is analyzed then wrapped in parens and negated.

__NOTE__: `not` doesn't take `key`, `value` strings.
Currently, this will produce a querystring, but it will not have the valid semantics.
Something like `?!(key=undefined)`.


LiveScript:

```livescript
inquire.not inquire \key, \value #=> ?!(key=value)
```

Javascript:

```javascript
inquire.not(inquire('key', 'value')) //=> ?!(key=value)
```

### Functions

##### eq(key, val)
Creates a `key=val` predicate.

##### neq (key, val)
Creates a `key!=val` predicate.

##### gt (key, val)
Creates a `key>val` predicate.

##### gte (key, val)
Creates a `key>=val` predicate.

##### lt (key, val)
Creates a `key<val` predicate.

##### lte (key, val)
Creates a `key<=val` predicate.

##### and(key, val)
If `key` is an `inquire` then it wraps the `inquire` in parens
and conjoins it with the current `inquire`.

Otherwise, assumes `key` is a string and `val` has a `toString` function,
then conjoins the current query with a new `key=val` predicate.

##### or(key, val)
If `key` is an `inquire` then it wraps the `inquire` in parens
and disjoins it with the current `inquire`.

Otherwise, assumes `key` is a string and `val` has a `toString` function,
then disjoins the current query with a new `key=val` predicate.

##### not(query)
Negates the supplied query.

##### generate()
Returns a formatted querystring.
